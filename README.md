# js-extractor
atom plugin for easily taking out a piece of code into a separate function or file, supports JSX

#Early stages notice
this plugins is in very early stages, expect bugs and missing features.
You have been warned.

# standard.js
This plugins deals heavily with code formatting and it would be almost impossible to create if I had to support every possible JS codestyle. By default it supports standard.js codestyle. If you prefer any other codestyle, feel free to fork and make a PR.
